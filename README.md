The object of the game is to create a hand with a value that is equal to or closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand
Number cards count as face value (2-10), Aces count as either 1 or 11, and Kings, Queens and Jacks count as 10
The dealer receives two cards, as does the player. All player cards are dealt face up, while only a single one of the dealer’s cards is.
Players can then hit or stand, with the former providing an extra card and the latter holding the cards at their current value.

Other Important Rules
However, as with all games, there are certain other rules that players should be aware of to give themselves a better opportunity at beating the house. These extra pieces of information are sometimes the turning point between a win and a loss.

Casino Blackjack Hints & Tips
Always remember to stand your hand when you have a hard hand with a value of 17-21, or a soft hand equaling 19-21. Being dealt a pair of Ace cards should result in a split option.

If you have a pair of fives and the dealer is showing any card between a 2 to a 9, use the double option. Meanwhile, if he has a 10 or Ace, be sure to Hit your hand.
